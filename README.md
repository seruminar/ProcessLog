# ProcessLog
Logs timestamps and durations of specified processes.

## How-to

Enter a process name (the name of the binary file or image name) in the lower-left text box and press **Start new watcher**. The query is added to the middle-left window. Any new processes with a name matching the query appear in the top-left window. Bolded rows are currently being watched, and total to the **Watching** value. **Total time** ticks when there is at least one watched process. When a process ends its record appears in the right window. Text in that window can be selected and copied.

Press **Save log...* to save a log file of the right window. Press **Stop** to stop and destroy all watchers, but leave log data unaffected.
